\section{Introduction}

Abstract algebra is a branch of mathematics that studies algebraic structures and their properties in a broad and abstract sense. It has its roots in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with significant contributions from mathematicians like Ã‰variste Galois and Emil Artin. Abstract algebra focuses on algebraic systems like groups, rings, and fields, providing a framework to analyze and generalize mathematical concepts.
