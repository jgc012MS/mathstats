Welcome to my website! I am excited to take you on a journey through my life, enriched by the experiences I had growing up in the vibrant San Fernando Valley. This community instilled in me a deep appreciation for culture and diversity, which fueled my passion for self-discovery and creativity.

 <img src="sfv.jpeg"  style="height:400px;width:800;padding:60px" align="left">
As a teenager, I explored various paths, from playing baseball to embarking on solitary nighttime jogs. These experiences kindled a desire for personal growth and set me on a quest for direction. However, it wasn't until I attended community college that my life took a significant turn.
</p>

<br></br>
<br></br>
<p>
There, I had the incredible fortune of crossing paths with a brilliant and patient PhD advisor, John Krueger.
	<img src="Images/sico.png" style="padding:60px;width:250px;height:300px" align="right">
Under John's mentorship, I discovered the power of research and its ability to shape our understanding of the world. His guidance was invaluable in helping me choose a research topic that resonated deeply with me, igniting my curiosity and fueling my academic pursuits. Throughout the trials and challenges of the research process, John stood by my side, offering unwavering support and wisdom.
</p>

While diving into the world of academia, I found solace and companionship in my faithful feline friends. My cat companions, with their endearing presence and unwavering loyalty, provided comfort during late-night study sessions and offered a listening ear when I needed it most. They became an integral part of my journey, reminding me to appreciate the small joys and find balance amidst the rigors of academic pursuit.

This website serves as a testament to the transformative power of mentors like John Krueger and the profound impact of our animal companions. It is a space where I strive to share the lessons I've learned, the challenges I've faced, and the triumphs I've celebrated along the way.

Join me as we navigate the realms of self-discovery, research, and the joys of companionship. Let's explore the vast landscape of knowledge and creativity together, inspired by the invaluable guidance of mentors and the unconditional love of our faithful feline friends.

Welcome once again, and let's embark on this extraordinary journey together, embracing the lessons of the past and the possibilities of the future!

    <h1>Set Theory and Me</h1>

    <p>
        My journey into the world of mathematics began at Pierce Community College. Despite having
	done very little in K-12 and being the first in my family to pursue a scientific degree, I
	found a love for mathematical reasoning. This passion was largely due to a great professor
	at the college who nurtured and encouraged my interest. I remember the first time I saw her
	sitting there like a student, in fact that's exactly what I thought she was a creepy student
	staring at everyone entering smiling in a big hoody. Until she got up righhhh as class was about to
	start and introduced herself and explained that she was a little quirky but was excited to
	guide us in our mathematical journey.

        I was inspired to pursue a career in mathematics by the story I shared and the meritocratic
	nature of the field along with the profound realization that through mathematics, I was learning to understand and even participate in the code of the universe.
	For a kid that had just failed "Algebra 2" in high school and had no acaedmic goals
	whatsoever this was a powerful guiding realization! This inspiration was not without its challenges. I faced a mix of high confidence and doubt from professors, counselors, and family members. However, my love for music and art provided me with the joy and autonomy needed to persevere and become a published mathematician in an area I find both special and surprising.

        My journey didn't stop there. I went on to work with world-class set theorist John Krueger.
	Together, we investigated much of his work on forcing and trees. My hope was to extend
	results to Shelah ( an absolute titan whose work spans many decades in the field ) on
	principles that when assumed in a mathematical universe imply the existence of a
	proliferation of combinatorial trees with counter-intuitive properties. It may interest the
	reader herein to note that while these properties are very technical on the surface there
	are some quite interesting philosophical implications, though dwelling too much on these is
	somewhat frowned upon in our strict math circles (so don't tell on me:)).

    <h2>Summary of My Paper</h2>
    <p>
        My paper, titled "Some Results on Non-club Isomorphic Aronszajn Trees", discusses the construction of non-club isomorphic Aronszajn trees with strong rigidity properties. I used the diamond principle to construct a family of 2λ+ many completely club rigid special λ+-Aronszajn trees which are pairwise far. The paper also discusses related results, such as obtaining a large family of Suslin trees with similar properties and generalizing the Abraham-Shelah result on weak diamond to higher cardinals.
