		 Project: Machine Learning Model for Identifying Research Problems and Techniques in Math Articles
				</h1>

		<div class="center">
			<h2> Objective:</h2>
		</div>
		To develop a machine learning model that can analyze math books and articles and identify the types of research problems and techniques they employ.

		<div class="center">
		<h2> Steps:</h2>
		</div>

		1. <strong> Step Description: </strong> **Data Collection**: Collect a large dataset of math books and articles. This could involve scraping websites, using APIs, or manually downloading files. Python libraries like BeautifulSoup or Scrapy could be used for web scraping, and requests for APIs.

		<br></br>

		2. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess the data to make it suitable for machine learning. This could involve cleaning the text (removing punctuation, lowercasing, etc.), tokenization, and possibly converting the text into numerical form. Python libraries like NLTK or SpaCy could be used for text processing, and libraries like scikit-learn or TensorFlow for converting text to numerical form.

		<strong> Status </strong>
		<br></br>
		3. **Labeling**: Manually label a subset of the data with the types of research problems and techniques they employ. This will be used to train and validate the machine learning model. This step could be time-consuming and may require domain expertise in mathematics.

		<strong> Status </strong>
		<br></br>
		4. **Feature Extraction**: Extract features from the text that could be useful for identifying the research problems and techniques. This could involve using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings. Python libraries like scikit-learn or gensim could be used for feature extraction.

		<strong> Status </strong>
		<br></br>
		<br></br>
		5. **Model Training**: Train a machine learning model on the labeled data. This could involve using techniques like logistic regression, decision trees, or neural networks. Python libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch could be used for model training.
		<br></br>
		<strong> Log </strong>
		<br></br>

		<strong> Status </strong>
		<br></br>

		<br></br>
		6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the model on a validation set. This could involve metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score. Python libraries like scikit-learn or TensorFlow could provide functions for calculating these metrics.
		<br></br>
		<strong> Log </strong>
		<br></br>

		<strong> Status </strong>

		<br></br>
		7. **Model Tuning**: Tune the model to improve its performance. This could involve techniques like grid search or random search for hyperparameter tuning, or techniques like early stopping or dropout for neural networks. Python libraries like scikit-learn or Keras could be used for model tuning.
		<br></br>
		<strong> Log </strong>
		<br></br>

		<strong> Status </strong>
		<br></br>

		<br></br>
		8. **Model Deployment**: Deploy the model so that it can be used to analyze new math articles. This could involve setting up a web server that uses the model to analyze text sent in HTTP requests. Python libraries like Flask or Django could be used for setting up the web server.
		<br></br>
		<strong> Log </strong>

		<br></br>
		<strong> Status </strong>
		<br></br>

		<br></br>
		9. **Monitoring and Updating**: Monitor the performance of the model on new data, and update the model as necessary. This could involve re-training the model on new data, or adjusting the model's hyperparameters.
