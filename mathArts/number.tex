\section{Introduction}

Number theory is a branch of mathematics that deals with the properties and relationships of numbers, both integers and rational numbers. Its origins can be traced back to ancient civilizations, but it gained prominence in the late 19th and early 20th centuries through the works of mathematicians like Carl Friedrich Gauss and Pierre de Fermat. Number theory has applications in cryptography, coding theory, and more.

\section{Group Theory Basics}

\begin{definition}
A group is a set $G$ equipped with a binary operation $\cdot$ that satisfies the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Closure}: For all $a, b \in G$, $a \cdot b \in G$.
    \item \textbf{Associativity}: For all $a, b, c \in G$, $(a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)$.
    \item \textbf{Identity Element}: There exists an element $e \in G$ such that for all $a \in G$, $a \cdot e = e \cdot a = a$.
    \item \textbf{Inverse Element}: For each $a \in G$, there exists an element $a^{-1} \in G$ such that $a \cdot a^{-1} = a^{-1} \cdot a = e$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\section{Ring Theory}

\begin{definition}
A ring is a set $R$ equipped with two binary operations, addition $(+)$ and multiplication $(\cdot)$, satisfying the following axioms:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $R$ is an abelian group under addition.
    \item Multiplication is associative.
    \item The distributive laws hold: $a \cdot (b + c) = a \cdot b + a \cdot c$ and $(a + b) \cdot c = a \cdot c + b \cdot c$ for all $a, b, c \in R$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
